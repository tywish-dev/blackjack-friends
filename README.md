# Blackjack Friends ♠️♥️♣️♦️

**Because losing virtual money is always better with company.**

Welcome to **Blackjack Friends**, the only app where you can split, double down, and bust in real-time with your buddies. We built this because we were tired of losing against AI dealers who definitely cheat. Now you can lose against a *Firebase-backed* dealer who... well, follows the rules, we promise.

## 🚀 Features that Slap

*   **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Join a room, share the code, and judge your friend's terrible hitting strategy live.
*   **6-Deck Shoe**: We use 6 decks because we like chaos. Go ahead, try to count cards. We dare you.
*   **Split & Double Down**: Did you get two Aces? **Split 'em.** Did you get an 11 vs a 6? **Double it.** Did you lose both hands? **That's on you.**
*   **Host Migration**: Did the host rage-quit after busting on 22? No problem. The game automatically promotes the next oldest veteran to Captain of the Ship.
*   **Sleek UI**: Dark mode, green felt vibes, and animations that make loosing feel somewhat premium.
*   **Soft 17 Rule**: The dealer stands on Soft 17. Use this information wisely (you won't).

## 🛠 Tech Stack (The Nerd Stuff)

Built with love, sweat, and a lot of `useEffect` hooks.

*   **React + Vite**: Fast enough to reload before you realize you made a mistake.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Because writing raw CSS is so 2015.
*   **Firebase Realtime Database**: Synchronizing your bad decisions across the globe in milliseconds.

## 📜 Rules of the House

1.  **Blackjack pays 3:2**. None of that 6:5 nonsense here.
2.  **Dealer Peeks**. If they have a 10 or Ace showing, they check for Blackjack. Save your drama for the turn.
3.  **No Crying**. Unless you bust on 12. Then you can cry a little.
